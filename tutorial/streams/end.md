# Streams

## What You Learned

Now that you've completed this section of the tutorial, you should be familiar
with the following topics:

1. How to process data declaratively, rather than algorithmically, using
   `Stream`s.

2. How to filter, transform (map), and sort elements of a collection.

3. How to reduce elements into a single value (such as the
   [minimum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#minBy-java.util.Comparator-)
   or
   [maximum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#maxBy-java.util.Comparator-)
   value).

4. How to group elements (based on some arbitrary property) to be processed
   together.

5. How to chain operations together to perform complex reductions.
