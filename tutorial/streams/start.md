# Streams

## What You Will Learn

In this section, you will learn:

1. How to process data declaratively, rather than algorithmically, using
   `Stream`s.

2. How to filter, transform (map), and sort elements of a collection.

3. How to reduce elements into a single value (such as the
   [minimum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#minBy-java.util.Comparator-)
   or
   [maximum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#maxBy-java.util.Comparator-)
   value).

4. How to group elements (based on some arbitrary property) to be processed
   together.

5. How to chain operations together to perform complex reductions.

We will focus on the more common operations and will avoid some of the darker
corners whenever possible.
