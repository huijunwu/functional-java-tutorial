# Optional

## Exercise: Get Value or Supplied Default

In this exercise we will extract the value from an `Optional`; however, if the
`Optional` is empty, a default value will be generated by a supplier.

Open
[`src/main/java/functionaljava/Optionals.java`](../../src/main/java/functionaljava/Optionals.java)
and replace the body of `getEmployeeContactInformation` with one that returns
the employee's contact information. If the employee doesn't have any contact
information, use `contactInformationFetcher` to retrieve it. Since fetching
contact information is an expensive operation, only do so if needed.

To test your solution, run the following command:

``` bash
mvn test -Dtest=OptionalsTest#testGetEmployeeContactInformation
```
