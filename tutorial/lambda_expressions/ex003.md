# Lambda Expressions

## Exercise: Define a Block-statement Lambda Expression

In this exercise we will define a lambda expression that is defined using a
block statement (as opposed to the single-statement expressions from the
previous exercises). The syntax for the block-statement is slightly different
than that used for single statements, requiring braces and a `return` statement.

Open
[`src/main/java/functionaljava/LambdaExpressions.java`](../../src/main/java/functionaljava/LambdaExpressions.java)
and replace the body of the `fibonacci` method with one that returns a lambda
expression taking a single parameter, `n`, and calculates the `fib(n)` (the nth
number in the
[Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)).

While it might be tempting to write this recursively, the na√Øve recursive
solution is stupendously inefficient. Instead, incorporate the following
iterative solution into your lambda expression:

``` java
long fib(long n) {
    long a = 0, b = 1;
    for (long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        b = b + a;
        a = b - a;
    }
    return a;
}
```

To test your solution, run the following command:

``` bash
mvn test -Dtest=LambdaExpressionsTest#testFibonacci
```
