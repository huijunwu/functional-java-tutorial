# Lambda Expressions

## Exercise: Define a Single-statement Lambda Expression with Multiple Parameters

In this exercise we will define a lambda expression that accepts multiple
parameters and can be described in a single statement. Like the
[first exercise](ex001.md), this will probably be one of the simplest lambda
expressions you will define.

Open
[`src/main/java/functionaljava/LambdaExpressions.java`](../../src/main/java/functionaljava/LambdaExpressions.java)
and replace the body of the `triangleArea` method with one that returns a lambda
expression taking accepts parameters describing the dimensions of a triangle,
`base` and `height`, and calculates its area.

Recall that the area of a triangle can be calculated using:
> area = ½ × base × height

To test your solution, run the following command:

``` bash
mvn test -Dtest=LambdaExpressionsTest#testTriangleArea
```
