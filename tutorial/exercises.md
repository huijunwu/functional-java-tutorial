Those unfamiliar with Maven or would like to run tests through an IDE, see
[Running Tests](running_tests.md) for help.

If, when you run the unit tests, you have trouble compiling your code, read over
the syntax described herein to see where you may have gone wrong. If the tests
fail, your implementation is wrong; use the parameters along with the actual and
expected results to guide you to where your implementation is wrong.
